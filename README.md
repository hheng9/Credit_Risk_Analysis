# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis:
### The purpose of this analysis is to use machine learning techniques to solve a credit card risk classification problem using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub. We use various resampling methods such as RandomOverSampler, SMOTE, ClusterCentroids, and SMOTEENN, as well as ensemble classifiers such as BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier to predict credit risk. By evaluating the performance of these models we can make a recommendation on which model should be used to predict credit risk.

## Results
### There is a bulleted list that describes the balanced accuracy score and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models (15 pt)
